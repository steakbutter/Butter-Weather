# Butter Weather

## Description

Butter Weather is a website that fetches the weather forecast for US cities by using the open weather API. <br> I build this project to solve the need of knowing how will the weather be on a determined US city. <br> Building this website from zero, made me realized how useful an API can be in future websites. Local storage also played a very important role on making the API work as intended. <br> The use of API can take your website from good to great.
